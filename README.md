I'm making a Tic Tac Toe game you can play in your browser!

#### Self-reflection
##### Overview
*Throughout this project, I encountered some of my most challenging moments yet. One of the major struggles was comprehending the concepts of modules, private functions/variables, and logical organization. Though I'm familiar with the basics of revealing module patterns and factory functions, I still need to work on more projects to fully grasp and implement these concepts effectively.*

##### Challenges Faced
The most daunting task was encapsulating the gameboard array to keep it private from the user while splitting the project into separate modules (I'm not even sure if this was a required task). Despite my efforts, achieving this goal seemed nearly impossible. I took inspiration from other developers' submissions, which also did not manage to make the gameboard array truly private.

##### Approach and Achievements
Despite the hurdles, I successfully tackled the challenge of logical organization. I meticulously separated the code into numerous small functions, each with a distinct purpose. This modular approach not only enhanced code readability but also allowed me to pinpoint and address issues more effectively.
